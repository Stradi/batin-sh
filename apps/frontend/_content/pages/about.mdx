Hey, I'm Batin. I am a frontend developer living in TÃ¼rkiye. I've met with programming circa 2013 and I've been trying to improve myself since then.
I am currently working as React.js team leader.

This website is my so called "digital garden". I am trying to write about things I've learned and things I am interested in. Because this is my website,
it doesn't have any ads. I don't want to make money from this website. I just want to share my knowledge and experiences with you.

## Socials

You can contact me by email at **hello** at **batin.sh**. Also I have some social accounts:
